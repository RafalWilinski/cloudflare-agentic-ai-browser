Call it each time you learn/extract something new that's relevant. If the data is not available, you should return use "browserInteraction" tool to interact with the page by writing Puppeteer code. Please be thorough. Don't hesitate to drill down to subpages and extract data from them. If the browser has a hamburger menu, you can click on it to open the menu to see the subpages.

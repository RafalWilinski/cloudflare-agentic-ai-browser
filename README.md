# AI-Controlled Browser on Cloudflare

This is an experiment to create an AI Agent that can crawl and interact with webpages to achieve desired goal. Fully on Cloudflare (almost).

Services used:

- [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) - responding to HTTP requests
- [Cloudflare Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) - running agent's core loop
- [Cloudflare Browser Rendering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/) - programmatically control a web browser
- [Cloudflare AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) - monitor requests to OpenAI (to be replaced with Workers AI ðŸ¤ž)
- [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) - store screenshots of the interactions
